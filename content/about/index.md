My name is Daniel Dinari (legally Danial) and I go by "doxxedd" in the ctf world.

I'm a 2nd year undergraduate student in **Queen's University** studying **Computing with a Security focus**. *BComp (Hons)*

I have an extreme passion for cybersecuity and love doing CTFs. I aspire to be a penetration tester in the future but for now, I look for junior cybersecurity internships each summer.

I have a lot to learn and I leave my main source of learning to be frequent participation in CTFs around the world along with completing [RingZer0](https://ringzer0ctf.com/home) challenges. But currently, I'm completing [TryHackMe's](https://tryhackme.com/) **Jr. Penetration Tester** and **Offensive Pentesting** paths. After which I'll go for my [eJPTv2](https://ine.com/learning/certifications/internal/elearnsecurity-junior-penetration-tester-v2) as well as diving in to the HackTheBox world.
