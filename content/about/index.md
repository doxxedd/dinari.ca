My name is Daniel Dinari and I go by "doxxedd" in the CTF world.

I'm a **4th-year** undergraduate student at **Queen's University** studying **Computing** with a **Cybersecurity focus**. *Bachelor of Computing (Honours)*

I'm currently a SOC Analyst at [**IBM Canada**](https:///www.ibm.com/ca-en).

I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity and CTFs, and I aspire to work as a Red Teamer or AI Threat Hunter.

I still have a lot to learn so I frequently participate in CTFs along with completing [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/home) boxes and [RingZer0](https://ringzer0ctf.com) challenges. I've also recently started exploring Adversarial Machine Learning to understand emerging AI-based threats. After which, I'll go for my [eJPT](https://ine.com/security/certifications/ejpt-certification), [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/), and [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#) as well as focusing more on HTB Labs.

... I'm also building a [1999 Civic Hatchback](https://instagram.com/bumblebee_ek) into a K-Swapped track car and fly FPV drones in my pastime (I go by “MapleFPV” in the drone world!). [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@maplefpv/)
