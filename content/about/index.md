My name is Daniel Dinari (legally Danial) and I go by "doxxedd" in the CTF world.

I'm an incoming 3rd-year undergraduate student at **Queen's University** studying **Computing with a Security focus**. *BComp (Hons)*

I have an extreme passion for cybersecurity and love doing CTFs. I aspire to be a penetration tester in the future but for now, I look for junior cybersecurity internships every summer.

I have a lot to learn and I leave my main source of learning to be frequent participation in CTFs around the world ([picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), [HTB](https://hackthebox.com), [QCTF](https://qctf.ca/)..) along with completing [RingZer0](https://ringzer0ctf.com/home) challenges. I'm also currently completing [TryHackMe's](https://tryhackme.com/) **Jr. Penetration Tester** and **Offensive Pentesting** paths. After which, I'll go for my [eJPTv2](https://ine.com/learning/certifications/internal/elearnsecurity-junior-penetration-tester-v2), [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#), and [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/) as well as focusing more on HTB Labs.
