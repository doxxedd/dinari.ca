My name is Daniel Dinari and I go by "doxxedd" in the CTF world.

I'm a **4th-year** undergraduate student at **Queen's University** studying Computing with a **Cybersecurity focus**.

I'm also currently a SOC Analyst at [**IBM Canada**](https:///www.ibm.com/ca-en).

#### Long Term Goals:
I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity and CTFs specifically, Binary Exploitation, Reverse Engineering and aspire to be a **Red Teamer**. I've also recently started exploring Adversarial Machine Learning because **AI Threat Hunting** sounds very interesting to me.

I still have a lot to learn so I frequently participate in CTFs along with completing [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/home) boxes and [RingZer0](https://ringzer0ctf.com) challenges. After which, I'll go for my [eJPT](https://ine.com/security/certifications/ejpt-certification), and [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/), as well as focusing more on Dreadnode and HTB Labs.

#### Hobbies:
... I'm also building a [1999 Honda Civic Hatchback](https://instagram.com/bumblebee_ek) into a K-Swapped track car and fly FPV drones in my pastime (I go by “MapleFPV” in the drone world!). [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@maplefpv/)
