My name is Daniel Dinari and I go by "doxxedd" in the CTF world.

I'm a **3rd-year** undergraduate student at **Queen's University** studying **Computing** with a **Security focus**. *Bachelor of Computing (Honours)*

I have an extreme passion for cybersecurity and love doing CTFs and aspire to be a penetration tester in the future.

This May, I'll be a Cybersecurity Consultant Intern at [**IBM**](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en) for 12 Months. 

I have a lot to learn and I leave my main source of learning to be frequent participation in CTFs around the world ([picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/), [HTB](https://hackthebox.com)..) along with completing [RingZer0](https://ringzer0ctf.com/home) challenges. I'm also currently completing [TryHackMe's](https://tryhackme.com/) **Offensive Pentesting** paths. After which, I'll go for my [eJPTv2](https://ine.com/learning/certifications/internal/elearnsecurity-junior-penetration-tester-v2), [OSCP](https://www.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/), and [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#) as well as focusing more on HTB Labs.
